If you meant to render a collection of children, use an array instead.```\nThe error message you're encountering suggests that some React component is trying to directly render an object as if it were a valid React child, which is not allowed. React expects strings, numbers, or valid React elements as children, but not plain objects. \n\nGiven the error is occurring on line 57 of your code, it's likely related to rendering the `component.element`. This suggests that `component.element` is trying to render an object or a list of objects directly.\n\nYou'll want to check the `MentionList` component setup and ensure it properly handles the data it's meant to render. It might look something like this:\n\n1. **Inspect `MentionList` component**: Ensure it's correctly extracting and rendering properties from the `props` provided to it. Specifically, look at how it's handling the `props` to create elements from `PageDescription`.\n\n2. **Array Mapping**: If `MentionList` is supposed to render a collection of page descriptions, ensure it's using `.map()` to iterate over the array of objects and convert them into React elements.\n\nHere's an example outline of how this mapping might look, assuming `pages` is an array of `PageDescription`:\n\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { PageDescription } from '@/lib/models/pages';\n\ninterface MentionListProps {\n  items: PageDescription[];\n}\n\nconst MentionList: React.FC<MentionListProps> = ({ items }) => {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {items.map(item => (\n        <li key={item.id}> // Ensure there's a valid key for each element\n          {item.title}    // Render a property of the PageDescription object\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default MentionList;\n```\n\n3. **Debug the `props`**: Add console logs to print out the `props` in your `onStart` and `onUpdate` functions to ensure they are structured as expected when passed to your `MentionList`.\n\nBy ensuring that you are correctly flattening and rendering each property of the `PageDescription` objects within your `MentionList` component, you should be able to resolve the error you're encountering.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1354}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":31},"start":2833,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1355}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":32},"start":4880,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1356}}}],"summary":"Fixing React child rendering error","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":3,"end":2618},"icon":"File","label":"taskpage/components/Editor/Mentions/suggestion.ts","metadata":{"path":"taskpage/components/Editor/Mentions/suggestion.ts"}}]}
