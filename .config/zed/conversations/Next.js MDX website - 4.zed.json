Long\"\n  className=\"float-right ml-3 mb-3 w-1/4\"\n/>\n\n32pixels is a website and software design studio led by myself, [John W. Long](http://johnwlong.com).\n\nI’m a multi-discipline product leader, designer, and marketing strategist with 20+ years of experience building web applications, crafting compelling content, and leading software teams. My passion lies in solving real business problems with thoughtful, user-centered design, product strategy, and product positioning that sells the product you have today.\n\nWherever I’ve worked, I’ve played a critical role in designing and building thoughtful, well-crafted experiences. Some career highlights include:\n\n- **[Radiant CMS](https://github.com/radiant/radiant)**: Built one of the first open-source content management systems made with Ruby on Rails, helping developers create and manage websites with ease.\n- **[UserVoice](https://uservoice.com)**: Helped build a user feedback platform that enables companies to listen to their customers, prioritize feature requests, and improve their products.\n- **[CloudBees](https://www.cloudbees.com)**: Contributed to tools like Jenkins and DevOptics, empowering engineering teams to optimize their CI/CD pipelines and improve software delivery.\n- **[Teamworks](https://teamworks.com)**: Enhanced a platform that helps sports teams manage operations, academics, and communications seamlessly.\n- **[Launchable](https://www.launchableinc.com)**: As an early team member, I designed a tool that uses AI-driven insights to optimize software testing, providing faster feedback and significantly improving development efficiency.\n- **[Unstack](https://unstack.com)**: Improved a no-code platform for marketers and entrepreneurs to quickly create landing pages, websites, and marketing campaigns. Unstack was later acquired by Elastic Path.\n\nI bring a unique blend of breadth and depth to my work — combining design expertise, product know-how, and a deep understanding of product marketing. I love partnering with startups and established teams to create products and marketing experiences that resonate with customers and drive results.\n\n**Need to get in touch?** Email me at [john@32pixels.co](mailto:john@32pixels.co).\n\n<IconGrid count={85} size={24} />\n```\n\n```js website/app/(pages)/about/page.js\nimport Markdown from \"./markdown.mdx\";\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Markdown />;\n}\n```\n\n\nThis error is occurring because the `useMDXComponents` hook is not being imported in the `about/page.js` file.
