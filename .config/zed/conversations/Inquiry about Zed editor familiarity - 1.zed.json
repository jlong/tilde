{"id":"52bdc0d3-9e0e-42a7-9a54-35e7bc80d5cf","zed":"conversation","version":"0.1.0","text":"I'm new to Zed are you familiar with the editor?\nAs of my last knowledge update in early 2023, I'm not aware of any specific editor that's widely known as \"Zed.\" However, there could be a few possibilities:\n\n1. “Zed” could refer to a text or code editor that has since been developed or popularized, and I might not have knowledge of it due to the cutoff.\n\n2. It could be a regional or less common name for an editor, or perhaps a nickname for an editor within a specific community.\n\n3. You might be referring to the 'Z' shell (`zsh`), which is a Unix shell that can be used inside terminal editors like Vim or Emacs when they are set to the 'Z' shell mode. But typically, the editor itself wouldn't be referred to as \"Zed.\"\n\n4. It's possible you're talking about 'ZedCode,' which was an object-oriented programming language and development environment from the 1990s, but it's not commonly used or referred to in modern contexts.\n\n5. You could also be referring to a custom or proprietary editor within a specific organization, or a new tool that has not reached widespread adoption or recognition.\n\nIt's always possible that a new tool has emerged after my last update. For the most accurate and current information, I'd recommend searching the web for \"Zed editor\" or checking with the source that mentioned this editor to you. If there's any other context you can provide, I'd be happy to help answer your questions to the best of my ability.\nCheckout https://zed.dev/\nThank you for providing the URL. As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, I don't have browsing capabilities or real-time access to the internet, which means I can't check current websites or their content directly. However, judging by the URL, `https://zed.dev/` seems to be the official site for a software development tool or editor named Zed.\n\nIf Zed is indeed a code editor, here's some general advice on getting started with a new editor:\n\n1. **Official Documentation**: Start by looking through the official documentation available on the Zed website. This should give you an overview of the editor, its features, and how to use it.\n\n2. **Tutorials and Guides**: Look for tutorials or getting-started guides that can walk you through the basic and advanced features of Zed.\n\n3. **Community and Support**: Check if there is a user community, such as a forum, a subreddit, or a Discord channel, where you can get help from other users.\n\n4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Learn the keyboard shortcuts, as these can dramatically increase your efficiency when working with any editor.\n\n5. **Extensions and Plugins**: Editors often have the ability to add extensions or plugins. Investigate what is available for Zed to enhance its functionality according to your needs.\n\n6. **Practice**: The best way to get familiar with any new tool is to use it. Start by using Zed for small projects or parts of your work, gradually increasing its use as you become more comfortable with it.\n\n7. **Feedback and Bug Reporting**: If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, see if the Zed website provides a way to give feedback or report bugs. This can help improve the tool and also get you support for any problems.\n\nIf you were looking for specific features or how-to guides for Zed, I would suggest starting with these approaches and branching out as you learn more about the editor and its capabilities.\n\n","messages":[{"id":0,"start":0},{"id":1,"start":49},{"id":2,"start":1451},{"id":3,"start":1477},{"id":5,"start":3366},{"id":4,"start":3367}],"message_metadata":{"1":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2024-02-23T22:14:24.094271-05:00","status":"Done"},"0":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-02-23T22:14:07.835105-05:00","status":"Done"},"2":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-02-23T22:14:24.094480-05:00","status":"Done"},"3":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2024-02-23T22:14:57.984801-05:00","status":"Done"},"4":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-02-23T22:14:57.986025-05:00","status":"Done"},"5":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-02-23T22:36:50.183653-05:00","status":"Done"}},"summary":"Inquiry about Zed editor familiarity","api_url":"https://api.openai.com/v1","model":"gpt-4-1106-preview"}
