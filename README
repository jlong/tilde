This is not my complete home directory, of course.
I'm using symbolic links to wire stuff into the right place.
Once you have this project, run setup.sh.

# Install

    cd Workspaces   # Go to the root directory where you store projects
    git clone git@github.com:jlong/tilde.git && cd tilde && ./setup.sh   # clone and install
